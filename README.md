# Springboard Data Science Career Track Certification Program

From September 2020 to February 2021, I completed a number of data science projects, including two capstones as a part of Data Science track. 

All of the documentaiton, codes and notes are found in this repository, as well as some links to resources that I found useful while completing this program.
